On Sunday morning Donny went into the yard and played with a dog. Sometimes a bird would come down to stay on the top's of the dog's house. Then Donny threw a stone at it. Suddenly the little boy began crying. Mother ran to Donny and asked him what was wrong. He said, "I've broken2 sister's plate. She has beaten me." "Why?" "I threw it at a bird, and it went straight to the plate."
